                <p>[No spoiler review, but only if you read the previous books]</p>
                <p>Suzanne Collins, how <i>dare</i> you destroy me like this after all these years? Even while I 
                    knew what was going to happen, I kept rooting for everyone to live. I was praying for 
                    a happy ending even though I knew it wasn’t going to come. The epilogue didn’t help; I
                    just felt even more sad thinking about the “what could’ve been.” It felt like the floor 
                    kept collapsing under Haymitch, like he kept getting sent to the next layer of hell 
                    through no fault of his own.</p>
                <p>How can a 16-year old be expected to keep the lofty promises these people made for him? 
                    That he made for himself? I thought I was invincible when I was that age, and any minor 
                    setback was a devastating failure on my part. No wonder Haymitch became an alcoholic! It’s 
                    a friggin’ miracle that he kept waking up every morning for the next 24 years to finally 
                    play a critical part of the rebellion he helped foment (which, I might add, he was only 
                    dragged into by FULL-GROWN ADULTS because he thought he was going to DIE, nevermind the 
                    consequences).</p>
                <p>To get more technical, I thought the writing was really good. I’ll admit that I skipped 
                    over the poems when I saw them, but the way it was implemented was a great way to 
                    reinforce the themes of the book. Maybe it was too on the nose (which might be why I 
                    skipped them when I got to them), but I’d rather writers err on the side of caution than 
                    the opposite. I know that Haymitch, even if he forgot the other songs, never forgot the 
                    raven (Snow) that continued to torment him.</p>
                <p>The biggest effect this book had was playing into my deep-seated fear of being alone. 
                    Not just physically alone, but to be unable to access the love of your family, or the 
                    companionship of your closest friends. To never have a shoulder to lean on, or someone to 
                    share life’s joy with. To be unable to have any of that because one near-omnipotent 
                    person holds a deep-seated grudge against your entire community and instills in your the 
                    fear that anyone merely associated with you will have the worst fate befall them. I’m 
                    happy that Haymitch was finally able to find these people in Katniss and Peeta 
                    (especially the former), but man, 24 years is a long time.</p>
                <p>I <i>will</i> be watching the movie when it comes out. I’m ready to be devastated again.</p>
